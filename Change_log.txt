Ver 27 (under development) major modifications:

1. Added lower case or mixed upper/lower case support for Liu08 scoring method.

2. Implemented Liu08 conservation scoring method without sequence weighting.

3. Now can choose between three residue conservation scoring methods:
		a. Liu08 - simple (w/o using sequence weights)
		b. Liu08 - Sequence Weighted
		c. Amino acid grouping based (ie. alphabet grouping)

4. Added ability to choose between above methods through GUI 'Edit settings' from 'File' menu.

5. Option added through GUI 'Edit settings' to choose if reference sequence needs to be included in calculation
   of %Identity and %Residue Conservation. Script changed to accomodate such calculation.

   Completed: Output (csv & html) are modified to reflect such changes
   Completed: Logging is added to enable logging the options chosen by user

6. Moved option buttons to choose 'residue conservation method' and 'include reference seq in calculations?' from
   'Edit settings' menu to 'Mismatch analyzer' canvas. This way makes more sense but looks ugly though.

7. Removed checkbutton for 'html formatting' from 'Mismatch analyzer'. It is set to True in code.

8. Tool 'Filter fasta by Blast's E-value' has been partly rewritten. Now this tool can filter by 'Bit score' in addition
   to 'E-value' filtering. Tool has been renamed as 'Filter Blast by Bit or E-value'.

9. Now 10-color-gradient-codes are read from Settings file for coloring reference seq by conservation score in HTML output file.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Ver 26 major modifications:

1. Adding residue conservation score by following methods:
		a. Shannon entropy (discontinued)
		b. Liu08

2. Adding color coded Reference sequence as part of html file output based on conservation scale for residue positions
   requested. Only in Protein-mode.

3. Changed %Similarity by alphanet grouping to % conservation using Liu08 method. These are implemented in both html
   and csv output file. Grouping by alphabet will still be used for coloring residues in html output.

4. In HTML output, space between letters in alignment section are increased using <spaced> tag.

5. Added ability for user to choose 'All residue positions' in Mismatch analyzer.

6. Added verification step to compare if Reference sequence matches exactly to corresponding sequence in input
   MSA file or input Sequences file (if needed) as part of tool 'Mismatch analyzer'.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Ver 25 major modifications:

1. Removed 'outfile' parameter option that was used as part of clustalo command. It was redundant now that Rescon allows
   choosing output folder.

2. Made GUI changes so as to appropriately accommodate clustal omega's web server options.

3. Made several changes to the function that manages clustal alignment using EMBL-EBI webserver.

4. Edited files -settings file, log file and user guide - to be called by complete file path instead of relative path.

5. In GenPept/GenBank to fasta converter, titles 'domain, phylum, class' were changed to more generic 'taxon-1, 2, 3'

6  In 'Mismatch analyzer', text file output is set to 'False'. CSV is better in every sense over this text output.
   If needed, it can be enabled by setting 'mismatches_text_output' to True.

7. Corrected bug - Mismatch analyzer fails if input clustal aligned MSA doesn't have symbol data about residue
   conservation in a column. For example, ClustalW aligned MSA doesn't have symbol line.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ver 24 major modifications:

1. External files required to run Rescon are put into a new folder.

2. Bug found and removed: Bug in 'subtree seqs extractor' where it suggests probable numbers if branch length input
   was not found in the tree file. This bug was Windows/Ubuntu specific. It is fixed now.

3. In 'Subtree Seqs Extractor' tool, the checkbox option 'Remove -ve branch length' was removed. It might confuse users.
   Now, code is changed to always extract branch with -ve value.

4. Now input residue positions in 'mismatch analyzer' can be separated by tabs (previously only comma was allowed.)

Note: 1. Have to clean up the feature - clustal alignment through internet.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ver 23 major modifications:

1. In process of facilitating clustal alignment through internet (Acheived but it needs to be cleaned up).

2. Added 'count of matches and mismatches' feature in both csv and html output.

3. GenPept to fasta converter is modified to account for Candidatus species.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ver 22 major modifications:
1. Results get sorted now in output csv file. Uses third party lib 'natsort' to achieve best sorting. Added ability
   to run without 'natsort' lib but sorting is done in undesired format. For example, [1,10,2,13] will appear as
   [1,10,13,2] if natsort lib is not used. If it is used, result would be [1,2,10,13] as user would expect.

2. Added a feature of accounting for negative branch length in the phylogenetic tree, if user opts to.

3. In Genpept to fasta converter, 'Taxon ID' and 'Version' are added as header options to choose from and 'locus name'
   has been changed to 'Locus ID'.

4. In Genpept to fasta converter, now you can change 'sensitive symbols that are allowed to be replaced in header id'
   through settings file or gui settings.

5. If 'amino acid similarity sets' is set to empty in either gui settings or settings file, now ResCon will treat
   as if processing is done in dna mode (ie. residue similarity will not be analyzed).

6. In 'Subtree sequences extractor', branch length probables are edited slightly to account for trees with less than
   6 branch lengths.

7. HTML code cleaned up a bit.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ver 21 modifications:
1. Removed the feature of replacing comma with '_$' in tool 'Fasta Description/ID extractor'. Instead standardized the
   way csv file gets written when comma or double quote is part of the string itself.

   As a part of above change, disabled the feature of allowing user to change '_$' with any symbol. Also removed feature
   that looks for '_$' when 'filter by seqs' description' tool is used.

2. Standardized csv file writing in tool 'mismatch analyzer'. If comma or double quote is in the cell value, now
   they are formatted in the standardized manner.

3. Added bar chart to html output showing similarity and identity % (using two methods:
	1. used Matplotlib	- successfully done but final software product size increases to > 150 MB.
	2. Used javascript in html5 - successfully implemented. Final software will remain the same size as now!)
