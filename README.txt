ResCon is a software suite made of seven tools that can be used to assist in analysis of 
residue conservation. It is written in Python 2.7 and can be run in Windows, Mac and Linux (Ubuntu).
The name ‘ResCon’ (or ResCons) is a space filler title for now and will be changed in future. 
See the user guide for further details about ResCon’s tools.
